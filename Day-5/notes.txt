                                /* IIFE : IMMEDIATELY INvoked Function Execution */                

Immedialety invoked Function Expression (iife) are JavaScripts Functions that are executed immediately.
They are typically used to create a localScope for Variables to present them from polluting the global scope.

Explanation : The Function is wrapped in paranthesis (function (){.....}) followed by () to immediately invoked it.

Example : (function addTwo(){                                      First Paranthesis         
            return num1+num2;                                       ^
                        })                                          |
          (Console.log(3+5)).                                      ( )                ( ) : Second Paranthesis

 # Global scope ke pollution se problem hoti hai kai bar to usGlobal scope ke jo variable hai uske polution ko hatanre ke liye.
