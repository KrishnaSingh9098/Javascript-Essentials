QUESTION 1: Interview Question: What does the following JavaScript code output, and why does it behave this way ?
     CODE : console.log(typeof(null));

Answer :One-liner Answer: The output is "object" because, in JavaScript, null is historically considered an object type due 
        to a bug in the language's early versions, which was never corrected for backward compatibility.

        This behavior can be surprising, but it's important to remember that null is a primitive value that signifies "no value" 
        or "no object." Despite this, the typeof operator incorrectly returns "object" for null due to the way the JavaScript engine
        was designed.

 HINGLISH : The output is "object" because JavaScript mein null ko pehle ek object type consider kiya gaya tha due to a bug in early
            versions, jo backward compatibility ke liye fix nahi kiya gaya.

            Yeh behavior thoda surprising ho sakta hai, lekin yaad rakhna chahiye ki null ek primitive value hai jo "no value" ya 
            "no object" ko signify karta hai. Phir bhi, typeof operator galti se "object" return karta hai due to how the JavaScript 
            engine was designed.
